        <h1 class="content-heading">Introduction</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="content-section" id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
        <p>The QA Site's (the site) client interface is built using almost pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In early
            builds, jQuery was used
            and with each update it is fitered out in preference for vanilla web tools, unless it is easier to use
            jQuery, which is the case for the calculator.</p>
        <p>The server side of the site is written in Node.js</a>. All
            the code is stored on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and then deployed on <a
                href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="content-section" id="setup">Setup</h2>
        <p>In order to work on this project, You will need to install a few things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Text Editor of your choice</li>
            <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have those things, you will need to add yourself as a collaborator to the project on Github and then
            you can clone it onto your local machine. From there you can do whatever you need to do the site.</p>
        <h2 class="content-section" id="login">Login</h2>
        <p>Now that we are all set up and ready to go, lets walk through the site and dive deep into what everything
            does. For starters, when you log onto the root page, it will diret you to the Login page. You will also be
            redirected here if there are any problems throughout the site. But, this page is pretty simple, just put in
            the same credentials you use to log into TeamDynamix.</p>
        <p>Once you hit the submit button, the login prompt disappears and the loading screen appears. It is an AJAX
            request that sends the credentials to the server, and then uses the TDAPI node module to verify that you are
            logged in correctly. After it returns success, it lets you into the site and lands you on the Primary
            Evaluations page.</p>
        <p class="tip">If your credentials do not evaluate to true, it sends back an error and notifies the user that
            the
            credentials were wrong. It then asks them to log in again.</p>
        <h2 class="content-section" id="loading">Loading</h2>
        <p>This loading screen (but really more of a loading bar-like image) is made out of pure css. The code is stored
            in the general css file that each page loads. There is also a few HTML elements that it uses and they reside
            outside of the main tag. Once the loading screen is called, everything in the main tag disappears and the
            loading
            screen shows. After the JavaScript has done what it needs to, the loading screen goes away and everything
            the main element appears again.</p>
        <h1 class="content-heading">Evaluations</h1>
        <hr>
        <!-- START Primary Page -->
        <h2 class="content-section" id="primary">Primary</h2>
        <p>This page is probably the most important page on the entire site. This page tells the evaluator who they need
            to evaluate next. There is also a lot of complicated calculations going on on this page. I will break it
            down into steps to help with the snackability.</p>
        <p>First, it makes 4 requests to get 4 different reports. Their IDs are 14236, 4807, 13996, 13990 and
            after everything is done, it has a report that has all the employees in the BSC, all the New Hires, all the
            final evaluation scores for each employee and also their preliminary scores.</p>
        <p>From there, it builds a somewhat complicated array of objects that is referred to as the Agent List. It has
            an Agent class that has some member variables, and member functions. Each Agent class also contains a Score
            class.</p>
        <p class="tip">For more on the Agent class, click here: <a href="#agent">Agent</a><br>
            For more on the Score class, click here: <a href="#score">Score</a></p>
        <h3>buildAgentList()</h3>
        <p>Add each agent to the agentList.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parameters</th>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>data</code></td>
                    <td>Object</td>
                    <td>A report that has all the employees of the BSC.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p class="tab"><i>Returns: Array&lt;Agent&gt;</i></p>
        <p>Second, after the agentList is built, it gets sent to a few different functions that combine the reports
            and the object. Basically all you need to know is that one function adds all the preliminary scores to the
            agent. The next function adds all the final scores. And lastly all the New Hires, Leads, DR, and Solutions
            employees get removed. The result is the finished array that will be used to do the calculations.</p>
        <h3>removeNewHiresLeadsDRSolutions()</h3>
        <p>Removes all the New Hires, Leads, DR, and Business Solutions employees from the agentList.</p>
